# FAR-R
R code to load and inspect EU-FAR data.

Data is provided in `./data/EU_FAR_database_2016-2021.ods` file.

You need to install the package for reading ODS files:
`install.packages("readODS")`

For best experience, run `read_data.R` file from RStudio.

The script reads data from file and plots Total and Mean Absorbtion of EU Funds.
